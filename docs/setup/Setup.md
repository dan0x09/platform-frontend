# Setup

## installation
``` npm i ``` will install everything that is needed to start working on this project.

## compilation + builds
Modules will probably be built by a TypeScript compiler. The build folder should not be part of the remote repository, as it is a reproducable version of the modules source code. the components module as well as other modules can be build using a npm script.
